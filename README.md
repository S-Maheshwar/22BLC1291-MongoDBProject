My project is about Online File Transfer Application, you can just upload any file you want and share the link to download it back. I have used MongoDB as the database, Express and Node js, and React.

# To Run
1) Open the server directory in integrated terminal window and type 'npm install' or 'yarn install'. Do the same for client directory too.
2) Open the server directory in integrated terminal window and type 'nodemon server.js' to connect to database.
3) Open the client directory in integrated terminal window and type 'npm start' to start the application.
4) Upload and enjoy!
